'''Let C be the number of calls that a program has made to the
avr-libc random() function (the Arduino is equipped with it). This
program finds the seed value with reasonable guessing-time (runs in
O(C)).

Since the analogRead() function is heavily biased, we use a sampling
to create a probability distribution that we select from. The idea is
to supply a standard sample space as well as enable the option of
supply a stream of values, either live or from a file. 

This code is heavily commented to make writing the section about it
easier. Oh, and if i ever have to read this mess again sometime.
